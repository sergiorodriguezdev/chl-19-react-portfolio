# Challenge 20 - React Portfolio

## Project Description

This is the third iteration of my portfolio I have built where I showcase projects I have worked on. The first version used HTML and CSS heavily whereas the second version relied more on Bootstrap and GitHub's REST API.

This new version is built on React and deployed to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` npm package.

I am looking to expand on this version by connecting it to a backend next and allowing visitors to contact me using the contact form. This marks the culmination of the 6 month bootcamp journey I embarked on.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
